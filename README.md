**Scenario**

An equipment company wishes to create a database to support the hiring of tools and machinery to
clients. The company has four types of equipment: power tools, such as drills and vacuum cleaners;
plants such as excavators and floor sanders; scaffolding such as mobile scaffolding and cantilever
scaffolding; and work wear such as protective clothing and high visibility clothing. Each piece of
equipment is identified by a number. Power tools are described by their brand, their model and the
voltage they use, whereas plants are classified by their model and their size in tonnes. Scaffolding
type can be traditional, aluminium or fibreglass; in addition, its width can be single or double, and its
strength is specified. Work wear is described by its tolerance and its size.
The company has various outlets and each has staff including a manager and several senior
technicians who are responsible for supervising the work of allocated groups of technicians. A
supervision record is also kept for a specific date.
All employees are identified by their number, name, date of birth (DOB) and address. Two types of
worker have been identified: shop floor workers and office workers. Each shop floor worker has a
specific skill and performs a specific task. Office workers on the other hand, are identified by their role
and the department to which they belong. Furthermore, a record is kept on the qualifications and the
employment history of each employee. In order to ensure orderly transfer of skills between
employees, a mentoring scheme is supported by the company.
Each outlet has a stock of equipment that may be hired by clients for varying periods of time, from a
minimum of four hours to a maximum of six months. Each hire agreement between a client and the
company is uniquely identified by using a hire number. Each client is identified by a number and a
name. The company insists that a client must take out an insurance cover for each equipment hire
period, offered by the company and which is administered by an employee. Each piece of equipment
is checked for faults when it is returned by the client, and the faults/defects/damage recorded. The
company keeps a record of the hire history of each client.
